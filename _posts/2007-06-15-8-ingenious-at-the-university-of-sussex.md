Meet a guy who regularly performs a three point turn - with an atom! Learn how 
to measure the charge separation in a neutron - and change the course of String 
Theory. Hear about a technology that could fly you from Tokyo to New York in 
under two hours.

All this happened at the University of Sussex in their Ingenious event where 
the exciting world of science and research was opened for all to see.
