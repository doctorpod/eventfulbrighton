With mike in hand, I venture into Jubilee Square to capture the essence of 
Fringe City. I meet a man wearing a judge's wig, a man with giant cardboard 
ears and a man making funny sounds with a guitar, a laptop and lots of wires. 
I also meet lots of lovely people who promise to review the performances they 
see during the festival - horah!
