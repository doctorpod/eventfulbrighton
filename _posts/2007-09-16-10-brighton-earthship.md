Mischa Hewitt of [The Low Carbon Network](http://www.lowcarbon.co.uk) takes 
Andy on a tour of the Brighton Earthship.

Imagine a building that heats itself during the winter, cools itself during the 
summer, deals with it's own waste, collects all the water it needs from the 
environment, is made from old car tyres, and looks beautiful - that's an 
earthship.
