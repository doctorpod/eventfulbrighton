We recently spent a pleasant and some what hilarious afternoon chatting and 
drinking tea with <a href="http://www.jonathan-brown.co.uk" target="_blank">Jonathan Brown</a> 
in his garden. 

We talked about him receiving the New Writing South/Brighton Fringe 2012 Best 
New Play Award. We went on to discussed his winning play, The Last Lunch, the 
inspiration behind it and his theatre group, Something Underground Theatre Company.
