I was in one of my favourite cafes this morning, <a href="http://www.viewbrighton.co.uk/restaurants/la-gigo-gi-info-28247.html" target="_blank">La Gigo Gi</a>,  and found Giovanni, the owner, playing guitar and singing away - and he was good! I've known him for a few months now and recently recorded one of our <a href="http://www.socialmediawhitenoise.com/2009/09/21/21-italian-ladies-of-the-night/" target="_blank">Social Media White Noise podcasts</a> there - where he made a brief appearance. By the way - his meatballs with pasta is one of the best I've ever tasted.
