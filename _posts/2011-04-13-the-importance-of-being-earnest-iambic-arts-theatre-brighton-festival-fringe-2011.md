Andy White talks to <a href="http://barefootplayers.co.uk/">The Barefoot Players</a>, the cast of The Importance of being Earnest showing at the <a href="http://www.iambicarts.com/">Iambic Theatre</a> in May. The performance is a sexy modern update of Oscar Wilde's classic social satire for Brighton Fringe Festival 2011 <-- lifted straight from <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Barefoot-Players/152984920895">The Barefoot Player's Facebook page</a>, hope you don't mind guys.

The cast, in order of appearance:

<ul>
<li>Sarah King plays the formidable Lady Bracknell</li>
<li>Sam Black plays Jack or is it Ernest Worthing? He's also a muscian/musical director and has composed a score</li>
<li>James Davies the director</li>
<li>Eleanor Conlon, she plays Gwendolen and doesn't laugh at her own jokes but laughs at dentist jokes from Sam and Andy (I think I have that right)</li>
<li>Andy Mansell - Algernon Moncrieff who apparently plays piano badly and in real life can design websites</li>
<li>Steven Bollschweiler - Algernon Moncrieff's butler</li>
<li>Katie Sommers - Cecily Cardue - Jack's niece - she's a bit mad, not in real life though</li>
<li>Edward Johnson - Dr. Chasuble - the village vicar - he's doing the set in real life</li><br />
</ul>
