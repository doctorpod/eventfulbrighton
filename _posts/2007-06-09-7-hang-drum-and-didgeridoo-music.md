Strolling along Gardiner Street in the North Laines, I heard these two guys 
producing an amazing sound, they were Danny and Matias, who call themselves 
Rishikesh. I just had to record them for the show. Matias was playing the 
didgeridoo and Danny had what looked like an up-side-down wok - actually a 
hang drum. Enjoy.
