I first noticed an <a href="http://spanishrevolutionbrighton.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">encampment on the Old Stein</a> yesterday. 
Today I spoke to <a href="https://twitter.com/campbrighton" target="_blank">Carlos Genova</a>, a resident of the camp, about what it's all about. It goes under several names including Spanish Revolution and Global Revolution - but I like the Twitter tag - <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23AcampadaBrighton" target="_blank">#AcampadaBrighton</a> (apparently this is going on in many countries across the world so you can just substitute Brighton with many other cities). In essence - it's all about peace, giving and environmental responsibility.

I wish them the very best of luck.
