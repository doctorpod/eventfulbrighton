In June 2007, to the anger of many Brighton residents, developers arrived on 
land next to Anston House, Preston Road, Brighton and bulldozed about ten 
mature oaks and copper beeches which had Tree Protection Orders. 

Soon afterwards, protesters set up camp on the land. I spoke to Colin West and 
Sandra Dunne, 2 of the protesters, to get their views.
