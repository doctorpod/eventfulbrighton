<a href="http://www.movinmelvin.com" target="_blank">Melvin Brown</a> gave a 
preview of his show, Soul To Soul (I have a dream), at Fringe city. We caught 
up with him after his performance and asked him about his show at the
<a href="http://www.komedia.co.uk/brighton" target="_blank">Komedia</a> and 
found out a bit about the man himself.
