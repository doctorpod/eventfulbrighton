<a href="http://www.startingovershow.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Starting Over Show</a> took place on Sunday 15th March 2009 at the Ship Hotel in Brighton. Here I talk to Suzy Miller, the lady behind the show, a number of exhibitors, and <a href="http://tankusthehenge.com/" target="_blank">Tankus the Henge</a>, the band playing at the show.
