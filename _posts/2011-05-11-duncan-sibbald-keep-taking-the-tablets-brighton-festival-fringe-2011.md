I chatted to Duncan Sibbald who wrote and produced Keep Taking the Tablets
- a moving and funny play about mental health and mental health services. 
Duncan told me about the story and inspiration behind the play which is based 
on his mother's mental illness and the challenges he faced looking after her.

Profits from the show are being donated to the charity 
<a href="http://www.mind.org.uk/" target="_blank">Mind</a>.
