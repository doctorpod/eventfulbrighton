The Udderbelly is a big, blue, up-side-down cow that tours the country attending 
various festivals including our very own Brighton Fringe Festival. 

I had the pleasure of sitting in the Udderbelly bar (actually a tent) and 
chatting with two comedy sketch teams who were playing there, 
<a href=" http://www.myspace.com/greedysketchcomedy" target="_blank">Greedy</a> 
(Louie Bayliss, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/felicitywren1" target="_blank">Felicity Wren</a>, 
Rachel Egan, Alan Freestone and 
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/jameswrencomedy" target="_blank">James Wren</a>) 
and <a href="http://www.prosfromdover.co.uk" target="_blank">The Pros from Dover</a> 
(<a href="http://www.theneilcoleshow.com/" target="_blank">Neil Cole</a>, 
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/philwhelans" target="_blank">Phil Whelans</a> 
and <a href=" http://www.myspace.com/richard_glover123" target="_blank">Richard 
Glover</a>).

Learn all about bowel gas problems, accidents that only rich people can have 
and what it's like to be kissed on the head by Jodie Kidd, what Rick Mayall is 
really like and how to succeed in cow tipping.
