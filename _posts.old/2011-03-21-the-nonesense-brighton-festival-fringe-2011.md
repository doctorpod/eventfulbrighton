Imagine working out continuously for 50 minutes while talking very loud, oh, and in front od an audience. <a href="http://www.andrewkazamia.com/">Andrew Kazamia</a> will be doing just this in The Nonsense, a play directed by his son, <a href="http://www.dinokazamia.com/">Dino Kamazia</a>.  <a href="http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/ticketing/index.aspx?ev=2469">This will be performed no less than 6 times at the Komedia throughout May</a>.

In this lively interview, Andrew and Dino gave some terrific insights into the story behind the play, and you can enjoy me struggling to pronounce Andrew's surname too.
