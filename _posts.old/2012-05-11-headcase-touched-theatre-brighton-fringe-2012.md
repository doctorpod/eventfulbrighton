Andy chatted with Beccy Smith and Darren East of Touched Theatre about their 
production, Headcase. It's the first time anyone's given a name to my furry 
microphone wind cover - from now on, it shall be kown as Gordon (more likely 
Brown, not the gofer).

From the <a href="http://www.touchedtheatre.co.uk/Headcase.html">headcase website</a>:
Combining tabletop puppetry and object theatre with powerful dance and visual 
theatre, Headcase shares the real experiences of a made up, mixed up teenager 
as she struggles to come to terms with what's going on inside her own head.
