  content: "I would love to know updates on these stories - even if they are just
    added as comments.  This is all really interesting stuff and not just to people
    in Brighton, as these kind of things happen all over the country.\r\n\r\nAnd can
    you not have a category for 'business', as many of the business networking groups
    are very active in helping residents and businesses in the city, like the FSB
    for example? \r\n\r\nThis is a really great site Andy, and I look forward to seeing
    more on it!"

  content: I understand that the 'so called' developer Timothy John Harding who has
    killed not only these special trees but has filed for bankruptsy and has avoided
    paying the fine has still not cleared the land or paid the tiny fines impossed
    in court. I also understand that the Planning Office is unable to locate the whereabouts
    of Mr Harding to reserve the s215 notice. Maybe they should visit the address
    as given in his banruptsy notice at 21 Lloyd Road, Hove, BN3 6NL or the address
    used to register his failed Bridgetown Company which is also where other property
    companies were registed (Stegglos Properties Ltd, Holetown Properties Ltd &amp;
    Arun Properties Ltd) all registed at Furnace Place, Killinghurst Lane, Haselmere
    GU27 2EJ. Why does it seem that our system can not follow through with such a
    criminal act such as this one!

In June 2007, to the anger of many Brighton residents, developers arrived on 
land next to Anston House, Preston Road, Brighton and bulldozed about ten 
mature oaks and copper beeches which had Tree Protection Orders. 

Soon afterwards, protesters set up camp on the land. I spoke to Colin West and 
Sandra Dunne, 2 of the protesters, to get their views.
