Yes, I know I'm always hanging around Pavilion gardens and the last episode was from Pavilion Gardens but I've been trying to interview this guy for ages. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/nellymysticwarrior" target="_blank">Sitar Man, also know as Nelly Mystic Warrior</a> has been playing the sitar since about 2005, after a trip to India. He also has a new project, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/waveheaduk" target="_blank">Wavehead, featuring Electronica Dance Music</a>. Entrancing!
