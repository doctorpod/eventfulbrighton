Steven Brett, Artistic Director of the <a href="http://www.nightingaletheatre.co.uk" target="_blank">
Nightingale</a> talks about Dip Your Toe, a large scale arts event, produced by 
the Nightingale with Brighton Fringe and The Marlborough Theatre, that took take place 
in the streets of Brighton to celebrate the Maiden Voyage of Lone Twin's, 
The <a href="http://www.theboatproject.com">Boat Project</a>. 

This spectacular 
event saw the creation of six bespoke Victorian style bathing machines, 
which acted as intimate new Brighton Fringe venues, in prime locations 
across the city in May 2012. We filmed one of the bathing machines being built 
on a foggy morning on Brighton beach.
